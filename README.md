# <span style="color:#2b2bb4">🚀 Exciting News! 🚀</span>

I’m thrilled to announce the completion of the **frontend development** for the project **Faltcare Maintenance Planning**! 🎉

### <span style="color:#2b2bb4">🌟 Project Inspiration</span>

This project was born from my experience living in a camp with over 500 shelters. Each room needed regular maintenance, but finding technicians for plumbing, electrical work, and other tasks was quite challenging.

That’s when the idea struck: **What if we could develop a software solution that allows customers, technicians, planners, and admins to collaborate seamlessly?** This would simplify maintenance management, prioritize tasks, and keep everything organized.

### <span style="color:#2b2bb4">🛠️ Technologies Used</span>

The journey has been fantastic, and I’ve worked with some amazing technologies, including:

- **Next.js with TypeScript:** For building the frontend interface
- **MongoDB with Mongoose ODM:** For managing and querying the database
- **Firebase:** For storing images
- **Nodemailer:** For sending emails
- **Custom Authentication:** Using JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

Additionally, I utilized:

- **Recharts:** For interactive charts
- **React Hook Form:** For form validation
- **EmailJS:** To send emails without a server
- **Axios:** For data fetching

### <span style="color:#2b2bb4">🚀 Next Steps</span>

The next phase involves completing the backend logic to support various user roles:

- **Customers:** Create notifications, order materials, update profiles
- **Technicians:** View notifications, visit sites, recommend materials
- **Planners:** Create and update work orders, track material deliveries
- **Admins:** Approve accounts, oversee administrative tasks

### <span style="color:#2b2bb4">🤝 Get Involved</span>

I’m actively seeking collaborators to help finalize this project. If you’re interested in contributing your ideas, code, or time, I’d love to hear from you!
